# Abelian Address Formats: Legacy Address and MLP Address

This document introduces the Legacy (ABEL Address v1) and Multi-Layer Privacy (MLP, ABEL Address v2) wallet address formats. It explains the reasons behind Abelian's upgrade to the MLP address and highlights the key differences between the two formats.

## 1. What are the Legacy Address and the MLP Address?

The **Legacy Address** is the original format for Abelian wallet addresses. It was designed for early adopters and basic privacy use cases.

The **MLP (Multi-Layer Privacy) Address** is an upgraded format designed to enhance privacy and functionality. It supports multiple privacy layers, such as fully-private and pseudo-private modes.

The key difference between the Legacy long address and the Multi-Layer Privacy (MLP) long address is the number of characters they occupy. Below is a summary of the character lengths for different versions:

-	**Legacy Long Address**: 21,458 characters
-	**MLP Long Address (Fully-Private)**: 21,718 characters
-	**MLP Long Address (Pseudo-Private)**: 462 characters

### Composition of Short Addresses

Short addresses are derived from long addresses using the following components:

```text
<Address Prefix> + <Privacy Type> + <Long Address Hash>
```

- Network Prefix: Identifies the type of address (e.g., Legacy, Fully-Private, Pseudo-Private).
  -	**Legacy short Address (Mainnet)**: `abe1`
  -	**Legacy short Address (Testnet)**: `abe3`
  -	**MLP short Address (Mainnet)**: `abe010`
  -	**MLP short Address (Testnet)**: `abe012`

- Privacy Type: A two-character identifier:
  -	**Legacy**: `(NONE)`
  - **Fully-Private (MLP)**: `05`
  - **Pseudo-Private (MLP)**: `06`

- Long Address Hash: This includes:
  - **Fingerprint**: 64 characters
  - **Checksum**: 64 characters

### Visual Representation

Below is a visual breakdown of the short address structure:

-	**Privacy Type** (colored section for privacy level)
-	**Fingerprint** (64-character hash for uniqueness)
-	**Checksum** (64-character validation component)

## 2. Why Does Abelian Upgrade to the MLP Address?

The upgrade to the MLP address format reflects Abelianâ€™s commitment to improving user experience, security, and adaptability in a rapidly evolving blockchain environment. Key reasons for the upgrade include:

-	**Enhanced Privacy**: The MLP format introduces distinct layers of privacy, allowing users to choose between fully-private and pseudo-private options based on their needs.
-	**Future-Proofing**: The new format aligns with upcoming features and products in the Abelian ecosystem, ensuring compatibility and scalability.
-	**Clearer Differentiation**: The structured prefix and privacy types make it easier for users to identify the address type and privacy mode at a glance.
