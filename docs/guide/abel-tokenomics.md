# ABEL Tokenomics

## ABEL Tokenomics

The Mainnet of Abelian Blockchain was launched in March 2022. ABEL is the symbol of the native token of the Abelian Mainnet,
and is mined during the creation of each block.

## Supply

**Total supply:** 225.18 million ABELs or 2<sup>51</sup>-1 Neutrinos where 1 ABEL = 10,000,000 Neutrinos.

*Pre-mined:* 20.58 million ABELs in the Genesis Block, that count towards 9.14% of the total supply.
These tokens are for fundraising, community build-up, and marketing.

The rest 204.6 million ABELs (90.86% of total supply) will all be mined by the community.
- The block frequency is set to 256 seconds.
- There are a total of 10 epochs. The first epoch is defined by 400,000 blocks, while the remaining 9 epochs are defined by 800,000 blocks each. Hence the total expected time to mine is 61.66 years.
- In the first era, each block reward is 256 ABELs. That means there will be 102.4 million ABELs created in the first era.
- Halving happens after each era. In the final era, the block reward will be 0.25 ABEL.
- Every 4,000 blocks is one epoch. The POW difficulty is adjusted after each epoch according to the the actual computational power
  of the network in the last epoch.
