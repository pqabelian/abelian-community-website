# Abelian Desktop Wallet Legacy User Manual

The Abelian Foundation has developed the desktop version of the Abelian wallet, which empowers users to create ABEL wallet accounts through an intuitive graphical interface. Additionally, users can export a 24-word mnemonic phrase for wallet recovery, import existing ABEL wallet accounts, send or receive ABEL tokens, and manage multiple ABEL wallet instances within a single Abelian Desktop Wallet Legacy.

**What's New?**

- **One-Click Migration:** We strongly recommend migrating from legacy wallets to MLP wallets. An MLP wallet no longer needs users to remember the maximum recoverable number of wallets. This enhances the usability greatly. Furthermore, we will only supports the brand-new MLP wallets and fades out the legacy wallet type.
- You need to install the Desktop Wallet Pro v1.0.0 and create a new wallet (fully-private or pseudo-private type). Then, use the Abelian Desktop Wallet Legacy wallet and use the Migration function to transfer all the ABEL coins from each legacy wallet to the new MLP wallet.

**Why Should You Upgrade?**

- The MLP wallet address is significantly easier to use without remembering any sequence number (aka maximum recoverable number of wallets). Furthermore, for the first time, you can choose to create multiple MLP addresses, each with different privacy level, fully-private or pseudo-private.

This user guide is designed to provide comprehensive instructions for the installation, configuration, and utilization of the features within the Abelian Desktop Wallet Legacy.

  ![Local maximum sequence number](/desktop-wallet/legacy/local-max-sequence.png)

## Import ABEL Wallet Account

:::tip
After upgrading the desktop wallet legacy version from 4.1.1 or earlier to version 4.2.0, you will need to re-import wallet accounts. Starting from version 4.2.0, it is no longer necessary to synchronize Abec full node data, significantly improving synchronization speed and reducing disk space usage.
:::

To import an ABEL wallet created elsewhere, follow these steps:

1. Click “**Select Account**” in the upper right corner, then select “**Import Account**，”as shown in the figure below:
![Select Import Wallet Account](/desktop-wallet/legacy/select-import-account.png)

2. Enter the **wallet name**①, the **mnemonic phrase** of 24 words②, and click on the “**Number of Addresses to Recover**”③ field, which will prompt a dialog box. Click the “**OK**”④ button.
![Input wallet name and mnemonic](/desktop-wallet/legacy/input-account-name-mnemonics.png)

:::tip
You need to estimate the number of addresses to recover. Here are three reference methods:
 
  a. If the desktop wallet is version 4.1.1, you can refer to the steps for [Receiving ABELs](#receive-abels) to create a new address, then check the newly created address name suffix in the “Select address” dropdown menu. The suffix `wallet name#m number` indicates the number you should fill in for the number of addresses to recover.
  
  b. If the desktop wallet is lower than version 4.1.1 and method a fails to create a new address, you can check the transaction count in the TXS tab. Multiply this number by 2, and if the wallet has been imported before, add the number of addresses filled in during the last recovery.

  c.If the mnemonic phrase exported from version 4.3.0 contains the text "Local maximum sequence number," you can directly enter the value here.

  d. If the wallet version is too old to run and check transaction records, you can estimate a number for the recovery address count, such as 100. However, avoid entering unrealistic or excessively large values to prevent the program from crashing
:::

3. The system will automatically generate the corresponding number in the recovery address instance count field. Click the “**IMPORT**” button, you will later see the message “**Account imported.**”. Click the “**DONE**” button to complete the wallet account import.

## Migrating ABEL Legacy Wallet to Multi-layer Privacy Wallet Account

The Abelian Foundation has developed the Multi-layer Privacy Wallet, which supports creating multi-layer privacy wallet accounts on the desktop. Users can choose the corresponding type for transactions based on their privacy needs. However, the Abelian Desktop Wallet Legacy does not support creating multi-layer privacy wallet addresses, so you need to migrate the  legacy wallets to the MLP wallets. 

This migration process will transfer all balances from the legacy wallet to the multi-layer privacy wallet,follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the “**MIGRATION**”① tab and click “**PASTE FROM CLIPBOARD**” or “**IMPORT FROM FILE**”② to input the recipient's multi-layer privacy wallet address.
![Migrate wallet](/desktop-wallet/legacy/migrate-mlp-wallet.png)

2. Enter your **master password**① and click the “**BEGIN**”② button to proceed with the migration. The amount will show the “Spendable” amount for this migration.
![Input the master password](/desktop-wallet/legacy/input-password-migration.png)

3. A prompt will pop up to preview the **wallet account**① and the **target wallet address**② for the migration. You can click the “**I WANT TO DOUBLE CHECK IT.**”④ button to return to the previous “**MIGRATION**” page for modifications, or you can click the “**I CONFIRM THIS MIGRATION.**”⑤ button to submit.
![Migration confirmation](/desktop-wallet/legacy/migration-confirm.png)

4. After submission, a progress window will display until you see the message “**N transactions submitted.**” indicating the completion of the wallet migration operation, as shown in the following image:(the number (N) of transactions submitted is determined by the quantity of coins in the account)
![Migration complete](/desktop-wallet/legacy/migration-progress.png)

5. Navigate to the “**TXS**” tab to view the corresponding transaction record. When the final status shows “**Confirmed**,” it signifies that the migration was successful.

:::tip
After upgrading the desktop wallet legacy version to 4.2.0, it is recommended that users migrate to the [Desktop Wallet Pro (MLP)](/guide/wallet/desktop-wallet-pro). The professional version does not require filling in the address count option during wallet import operations and is more user-friendly for large amount transfers, avoiding the “allowed max number 5” error in most cases.
