# Abelian Desktop Wallet Pro (MLP) Manual

## Introduction

This document aims to provide professionals and advanced users with comprehensive steps to successfully install and configure the Abelian Desktop Wallet Pro (MLP) - Your Gateway to Enhanced Privacy and Customization!

Elevate your crypto experience with the brand-new Desktop Wallet Pro (MLP) v1.0.0, a  desktop wallet designed to cater to your multi-layer privacy requirements. MLP stands for Multi-Layer Privacy.

**What's New?**

**•	Support for multi-layer privacy:**

  **a. Fully-Private Address:** Your transactions are encrypted and untraceable, and balances in your wallets remain hidden, ensuring maximum security and anonymity.

  **b. Pseudonymous Address:** The privacy level is comparable to that of Bitcoin, namely, publicly visible coin values and traceable transactions, while benefiting from much lower gas fees and much increased throughput.

**•	Support for multiple recipients:**

  **a. Fully-Private Recipient:** Allows up to 5 recipients, ensuring secure and private transactions.

  **b. Pseudo-Private Recipient:** Allows up to 100 recipients with a maximum of 50 unique recipients, providing flexibility for larger transactions.

**•	Significant improvement in both speed and storage:** the old, original Desktop Wallet Legacy requires users to spend hundreds of hours and even days to sync up the entire Abelian block-chain when running the desktop application for the first time. It also takes over 100GB of storage space. This brand new Desktop Wallet Pro (MLP) v1.0.0 takes only 45 minutes or less (depending on your network speed and bandwidth) to complete the one-time synchronization and less than 100MB of storage.

**•	Introduced the concept Memo,** which allows users to write messages onto the post-quantum and immutable Abelian ledger. For the first time on Abelian, we can now write our personal notes onto the ledger permanently.


**Why Should You Upgrade?**

•	Existing users of Desktop Wallet Legacy are strongly recommended to migrate now to this brand new Desktop Wallet Pro (MLP) so that they no longer need to remember the maximum recoverable number of wallets. To migrate, we need to create a new wallet at the Desktop Wallet Pro (MLP) and then use the Desktop Wallet Legacy to transfer all the ABEL coins to the new wallet.

•	For the first time, you can create wallets, some of them are fully-private and some others are pseudo-private.

Upgrade to the Desktop Wallet Pro (MLP) v1.0.0 today and create a new wallet now.

![Create a wallet address](/desktop-wallet/pro/create-wallet-address.png)<br>

:::tip
Pseudo-private addresses offer less privacy compared to fully-private addresses, but they provide faster transfer speeds. In contrast, fully-private addresses prioritize privacy and security, although this comes at the cost of slower processing speeds.
:::

3. For instance, to create a Pseudo-Private address, please wait until the wallet address is generated, at which point you will see the corresponding status message displayed "**Generate a new Pseudo-Private address in this account**" changes to "**Successfully**." Click the "**Close**" button.

  ![Copy the short wallet address](/desktop-wallet/pro/copy-short-address.png)<br>

:::tip
Once an address is generated, you can use either the full address or the short address to transact (sending and receiving ABEL). Currently, we recommend using the short address as it is easier to save and send due to fewer characters.
