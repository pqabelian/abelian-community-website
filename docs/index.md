  - title: Documents Correction/Submission
    details: The Abelian community needs everyone to build it together. We welcome corrections to errors in the content of the community's documents, And welcome to submit your experience sharing, open-source projects, and tools. (can be named/anonymous/link).
  - title: Quantum-Safe Blockchain
    details: As the advancement of quantum computing continues to accelerate, hackers are also leveraging the exponentially more powerful quantum computers to hack blockchain networks and have already been putting the security of major Blockchain systems at risk in the dawn of quantum computing. Abelian is the new generation of blockchain, which, by design, is secure against attacks from quantum computers. The Abelian Foundation R&D team, which consists of cryptographers, mathematicians and crypto engineers, has designed some advanced lattice-based cryptographic schemes based CRYSTALS-Dilithium, which is an NIST standardized cryptographic primitive. The vision of Abelian is to create a store of value digital asset, ABEL, as the Digital Gold 2.0, which is quantum-safe and privacy-preserving.
  - title: Multi-Tier Privacy Preserving
    details: ABEL, as the Digital Gold 2.0, is both quantum-safe and privacy-preserving. Thanks to the innovative technologies developed by the Abelian Foundation's R&D team, Abelian supports multi-tier privacy preserving assurance to ABEL wallets which can be pseudonymous, fully private, as well as complaint-private. The technologies of Abelian include lattice-based linkable ring signature, commitment schemes and zero-knowledge proofs based on NIST standardized cryptographic primitives, namely CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium.
